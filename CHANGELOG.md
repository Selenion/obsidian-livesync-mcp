# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- `read_note_content` now raises `ValueError` on missing or malformed CouchDB chunks instead of silently skipping them — this was causing sections to disappear after search-replace on large documents
- `write_note` now creates the new chunk before deleting old ones so a mid-write failure cannot permanently corrupt the document
- `obsidian_update_note` catches `ValueError` from the read stage and returns an explicit error message instead of overwriting the note with incomplete content

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- Initial release: remote MCP server for Obsidian vault via CouchDB/LiveSync
- 20 tools: notes CRUD, properties, tags, canvas, link graph, templates
- OAuth 2.1 authentication for Claude.ai and Claude Code

### Docs

- Clarified that the built-in OAuth client is pre-configured for Claude only; added instructions for registering additional clients
